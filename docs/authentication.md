# Authentication

If you're just trying to bootstrap a proof-of-concept application on your local workstation, you don't technically have to worry about giving ActionCable the ability to distinguish between multiple concurrent users. However, **the moment you deploy to a host with more than one person accessing your app, you'll find that you're sharing a session and seeing other people's updates**. That isn't what most developers have in mind.

## Authentication != Authorization

Libraries like Pundit, CanCanCan and Authz don't work on reflexes and might justify keeping state mutations with destructive outcomes in the controller.

Another valid approach to authorization is to make use of the `before_reflex` callbacks, where you could potentially call `throw :abort` if the user is acting out above their pay grade.

## Encrypted Session Cookies

You can use your default Rails encrypted cookie-based sessions to isolate your users into their own sessions. This works great even if your application doesn't have a login system.

{% code title="app/controllers/application\_controller.rb" %}
```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :set_action_cable_identifier

  private

  def set_action_cable_identifier
    cookies.encrypted[:session_id] = session.id.to_s
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="app/channels/application\_cable/connection.rb" %}
```ruby
module ApplicationCable
  class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
    identified_by :session_id

    def connect
      self.session_id = cookies.encrypted[:session_id]
    end
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

## User-based Authentication

Many Rails apps use the current\_user convention or more recently, the [Current](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CurrentAttributes.html) object to provide a global user context. This gives access to the user scope from _almost_ all parts of your application.

{% code title="app/controllers/application\_controller.rb  " %}
```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :set_action_cable_identifier

  private

  def set_action_cable_identifier
    cookies.encrypted[:user_id] = current_user&.id
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="app/channels/application\_cable/connection.rb " %}
```ruby
module ApplicationCable
  class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
    identified_by :current_user

    def connect
      user_id = cookies.encrypted[:user_id]
      return reject_unauthorized_connection if user_id.nil?
      user = User.find_by(id: user_id)
      return reject_unauthorized_connection if user.nil?
      self.current_user = user
    end
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

Note that without intervention, your Reflex classes will **not** be able to see current\_user. This is easily fixed by setting `self.current_user = user` above and then delegating current\_user to your ActionCable Connection:

{% code title="app/reflexes/example\_reflex.rb" %}
```ruby
class ExampleReflex < StimulusReflex::Reflex
  delegate :current_user, to: :connection

  def do_stuff
    current_user.first_name
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

## Devise-based Authentication

If you're using the versatile [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) authentication library, your configuration is even easier.

{% code title="app/channels/application\_cable/connection.rb" %}
```ruby
module ApplicationCable
  class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
    identified_by :current_user

    def connect
      self.current_user = find_verified_user
    end

    protected

    def find_verified_user
      if current_user = env["warden"].user
        current_user
      else
        reject_unauthorized_connection
      end
    end
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

Now you're free to delegate current\_user. Be home by lunch:

{% code title="app/reflexes/example\_reflex.rb" %}
```ruby
class ExampleReflex < StimulusReflex::Reflex
  delegate :current_user, to: :connection
end
```
{% endcode %}
